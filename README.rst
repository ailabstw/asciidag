asciidag - draw DAGs as ASCII art
=================================


Overview
--------

This is a direct port of the `Git`_ log graphing code, which draws
directed acyclic commit graphs as ASCII art. It was done very
mechnically and quickly, so the code is not Pythonic. Dependencies on
`Git`_ specifics should be gone but and look and feel remains.

This project is alpha quality and subject to breaking API changes.

If you are thinking about doing a large refactoring, please submit an
issue for discussion first; I consider it potentially worth staying
close to the `Git`_ source.


Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/sambrightman/asciidag.git
    cd asciidag && pip install .
    tests/demo.py

You likely need to use ``sudo`` for the install unless you work in a
`Python virtual environment`_ or use the ``--user`` option to
``pip``. Will soon be on `PyPI`_.
